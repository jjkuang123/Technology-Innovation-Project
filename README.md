Technology Innovation Project 2021 Semester 2

Distance Learning 

The initial idea is an application to help people acquire a second language. 
The application will have an emphasis on immersive language learning as opposed to 
repetition learning which is the predominant method of learning right now.
It will also make use of crowd-source efforts for people to, as a whole community, 
help build up most of the resources in any given language, the application will systematize many 
aspects of the learning process as well as provide a list of resources varying in usefulness and difficulty.
Finally, the application will also match people into groups of people seeking to learn and people willing 
to teach to form cohesive groups of learners that can share the work and so become more immersed in the 
target language theyâ€™re trying to acquire.
